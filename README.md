# Pulse-Template2022
This has the code for a community outreach event with middle school students. i've pre filled out some of the boring stuff and made comments instructing what to do. only thing is that the Talons do not match the robots and need to be configured 

This repository is only meant to give the src folder for the project because i hate git. so just make a new times robot template, then delete the existing code withing Robot.java. then copy and paste my Robot.java code
